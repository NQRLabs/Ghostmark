# Ghostmark
Ghostmark is a browser-based image steganography tool that hides one image inside another using seeded, randomized LSB encoding. It automatically converts the hidden image to pure black-and-white with Floyd-Steinberg dithering and embeds a reproducible seed for perfect decodingâ€”all fully offline and private.
